The yellow curves represent the actual values, the blue ones are median values. The plot represents a full-size Keras model and uses full \textit{float-32} weights.}

    \caption{Summary of training a Squeezenet-type Neural Network with 30 epochs of training, a batch size of 20 samples and LFW as a training dataset. The yellow curves represent the actual values, the blue ones are median values. The plot represents a quantized Keras model and uses uses \textit{uint8} weights, as any TF-Lite model should. We can see that the TF-Lite model has some pronounced spikes in both accuracy and loss around epoch 20, which might have been caused by the limited representation power of unsinged 8 bit integers.}
