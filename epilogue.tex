When setting out to work on \textit{TinyFace}, we were right the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, back when places were starting to close down, and everybody was ordered to stay home. As of September 2020, when these lines are written, not a whole lot more has become any clearer. Still, I consider it relevant to mention this situation we are in, as it has had its obvious effects on all of us, and this project would have likely looked different too, had it not been for these unusual and strange times. \par
On another note, I would like to close this work by expressing my gratitude to my supervisor, Alex, for his being always so incredibly positive and helpful in all situations, and for everything he has taught me. \par
I would also like to thank Mom and Dad for their support. I do feel very privileged for having them.
