Machine learning powered facial recognition is a capable and versatile  tool, orchestrating cutting-edge applications in many areas of our daily lives. The backbone of many of these methods are deep, convolutional neural networks, which enable us to develop increasingly complex systems for face detection, recognition and processing. Deep CNN's traditionally require copious amounts of computational power and storage, yet the world of embedded devices often abounds in just the opposite, having many performance and storage constraints instead. We are henceforth required to find innovative solutions and workarounds for these limitations, while keeping quality and speed compromises at a minimum, if we want to run these advanced models on small, low-powered embedded systems. This work presents a machine-learning based application of human face detection, built with a TensorFlow-Lite backend and achieving a model size in the low hundreds of KB, while leveraging optimization methods such as quantization and pruning of weights, on a fully convolutional neural network model architecture. We further try to automate the workflow of building, training and optimizing new, deep, convolutional neural network models for embedded machine learning as much as possible, and, in the end, strive to present a working ansatz for solving the challenge of having an integrated, end-to-end ML-powered face detection product on tiny, micro-controller and edge devices.
